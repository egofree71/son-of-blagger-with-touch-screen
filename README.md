**Project description :**

Son of blagger is a platform game made in 1983 for the commodore 64. It was written by Anthony Crowther (c.f http://tinyurl.com/p9zmthp)
Anthony Crowther was a famous programmer at that time, as very often he was writing alone his games (doing programming, graphics and music). He was also a very prolific programmer, as he could write games in a few weeks. I was a fan of Anthony Crowther and i decided to make a remake of 'Son of blagger'.
As i wanted the remake to look and behave as much as possible as the original game, i spent a lot of time doing reverse engineering of the C64 executable. I updated the graphics by smoothing them and adding light and shadow effects. This is the first trime i tried to program a game.

**Gameplay:**

The goal of the player on each level is manipulate Blagger, a burglar, to collect the scattered keys and then reach the safe. The keys must be collected and the safe opened in a set amount of time. Blagger can walk either left or right, or jump left or right. He must avoid monster and deadly objects.

**Keys :**

Left and right arrows to move and space to jump.

The player can't make 'double jumps', except if he is on a slide. Beyond a given distance, the falls are deadly, except if he is on a slide.
